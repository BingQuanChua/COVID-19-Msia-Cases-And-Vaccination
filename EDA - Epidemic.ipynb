    "3) `date_announced`: date of declaration as cluster<br>\n",
    "4) `date_last_onset`: most recent date of onset of symptoms for individuals within the cluster. note that this is distinct from the date on which said individual was tested, and the date on which their test result was received; consequently, today's date may not necessarily be present in this column.<br>\n",
    "5) `category`: classification as per variable `cluster_x` above<br>\n",
    "6) `status`: active or ended<br>\n",

    "### Healthcare \n",
    "\n",
    "_The datasets below have been constructed to provide 3 kinds of insight. First, the inflow and outflow of patients from quarantine centres, hospitals, and intensive care is, without any further scaling or context, critical to monitor - especially when clear divergences between infections and healthcare outcomes start to be observed (e.g. due to vaccination). Second, comparing against available capacity (number of beds, intensive care units, ventilators) allows for understanding of the strain exerted by the epidemic on the healthcare system. Third, the inclusion of datapoints on non-Covid patients demonstrates the interactions between the epidemic and broader health outcomes._\n",
