# Malaysia COVID-19 Cases and Vaccination

An in-depth extension of our previous [Assignment](https://github.com/BingQuanChua/COVID-19-Msia-Mining).


## üìöDatasets	

Data taken as of **`6-10-2021`** (cut off date)

Data source:

1. COVID-19 Open Data from the Minister of Health (MoH)  
   <a href='https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public' target="_blank">https://github.com/MoH-Malaysia/covid19-public</a>

2. Vaccination Data from COVID-19 Immunisation Task Force (CITF)  
   <a href='https://github.com/CITF-Malaysia/citf-public' target="_blank">https://github.com/CITF-Malaysia/citf-public</a>


## üìñTable of Contents

A list of questions that we have came up with.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis**

* Analyse which group of population are more vulnerable to COVID cases in Malaysia.
* Analyse how COVID cases vary across time dimensions at different granularity.
* What is the stationarity of the time-series dataset?
* What are the vaccination and registration rates per state in Malaysia?
* What are the types and total number of side effects for each type of vaccine?
* Which type of vaccine is given to more people?
* Which states are recovering? Which of the states shows a decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases?
* When is the time of the day with most MySejahtera check-ins?
* What are the dates with the highest number of checkins? How does it correlate with the number of cases and deaths during the day?
* Rate of Serious Vaccine Side Effect VS COVID Death Rate without obtaining vaccine, which one is more dangerous?

### **Clustering Analysis**  

* How well does each state handle COVID-19 cases based on past COVID-19 cases and deaths records?

### **Regression and Classification** 

* By utilizing the previous COVID-19 records, is it possible to construct a model capable of predicting/classifying the number of cases for the upcoming day or week?

### **Time-series Regression**

* Is it possible for the government to predict the number of daily new cases accurately based on past data in order to deploy appropriate movement control measures?
