# Malaysia COVID-19 Cases and Vaccination

An in-depth extension of our previous [Assignment](https://github.com/BingQuanChua/COVID-19-Msia-Mining).

Our work must consist of 
- ~~1Ô∏è‚É£ association rule mining algorithm,~~ => change to :one: of the below
- at least 2Ô∏è‚É£ classification models, 
- at least 2Ô∏è‚É£ regression models, and 
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ clustering technique.

We must provide visualization to your findings and analyze them accordingly.
