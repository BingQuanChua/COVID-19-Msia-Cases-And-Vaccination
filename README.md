# Malaysia COVID-19 Cases and Vaccination

An in-depth extension of our previous [Assignment](https://github.com/BingQuanChua/COVID-19-Msia-Mining).

Our work must consist of 
- ~~1Ô∏è‚É£ association rule mining algorithm,~~ => change to :one: of the below
- at least 2Ô∏è‚É£ classification models, 
- at least 2Ô∏è‚É£ regression models, and 
- 1Ô∏è‚É£ clustering technique.

We must provide visualization to your findings and analyze them accordingly.

## üìöDatasets	

Data taken as of **`6-10-2021`**

## ‚ùìQuestions

**Clustering**
* Access how well does each state handle covid cases based on pass covid records (cases, population, test)
Suggested methods: time-series clustering.
PIC: Ryan

**Regression**
* In order to deploy appropriate movement control measures, how can the government accurately predict of weely new cases based on past data?
* Predict the vaccination rate based on past data?
Suggested methods: LSTMNet, ARIMA
PIC: Bing

**Classification**
* By using previous 3, 5, 7 days covid records, come out with a model that can classify next day / week‚Äôs cases.
Suggested methods: dunno
PIC: KY
